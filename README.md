# Wellbeing-Support-App
CS317 Mobile App Group Assessment


Your app may focus on support for individuals, for community groups, for sports groups or family/friendship groups. 
You should support one or more of the Five Ways to Wellbeing 

Connect with other people;
Be physically active;
Learn new skills;
Give to others;
Pay attention to the present moment (mindfulness).

The application should exploit mobile features such as sensors, location, and communication. It should support a range of devices and screen sizes (from smaller smart phones through to tablets). The application can be cross platform or platform specific but should run on Android and/or iOS. You can write the app using:

HTML, JavaScript, and CSS;
a cross-platform framework such as ReactNative, PhoneGap, or iOnic;
a webview with Android and/or iOS wrappers;
or an Android / iOS native app.

(ReactNative was used however not everyone was able to use the software henceforth we have made the app pure HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, PHP)

The aim is to develop a prototype that shows key elements of your application but it does not have to be a full working application with some elements 
placeholder or simplified - you should simulate any aspects of the code that is not possible to develop within the project (i.e. communication with external hardware)
